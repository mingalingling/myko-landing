Payments
MyKo does not process payments in the app.
Any payments for coaching are handled directly between users outside the app (e.g., cash, Venmo, Apple Pay). MyKo does not store or process payment card information for coaching sessions.
Public vs. Private
Coach profiles (e.g., name, sport, city/state, bio, Instagram link) may be visible to users in the app.
Player facility addresses are only shared with the booked coach for that lesson.
Sharing of Information
We do not sell your personal data.
We may share limited data with service providers that help run the app (e.g., hosting, databases, image hosting, maps/locations, analytics). These providers must protect your data and use it only to provide services to us.
We may share information if required by law, to protect rights, or to prevent fraud or abuse.
Device Permissions
Camera/Photos: to upload a profile image (optional).
Notifications: to send booking confirmations and reminders (optional; you can turn this off in system settings).
Data Retention
We keep data while your account is active and as needed to run the app.
If you delete your account, we permanently delete your profile, messages, bookings, availability, and uploaded content, subject to lawful retention needs.
Your Choices & Rights
You can update your profile in the app.
You can delete your account at any time: Profile → Settings → Delete Account.
For data access or export requests, contact us at [your-email].
Security
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
International Transfers
We may process and store data in the United States and other countries. These locations may have different data protection laws than your home country.
Children’s Privacy
MyKo is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.
Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated version here with a new “Last updated” date.
